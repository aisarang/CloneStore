1.index.html
	a) On click event is fine. It is actually better than the hover functionality.
2.product.html
	a) The current images are sourced via hardcode, i'll provide a database for you to test against. 
	b) The retailers on the right side should be interactive and sort the images from each respective "retailer"
	c) Colors/Fabric on the lefthand side should also work the same way and filter center images
	d) The add to cart/remove from cart works as intended and is good
3.mycart.html
	a) The central "model pane" should be Shirt, Pants, Shoes, from top to bottom - if you can
	b) Everything else looks great
4.SignIn.html
	a) Use "emailaddress" and "password"
	b) No need to concern ourselves too much with the data for now
5.SignUp.html
	a) For signin, all we want is "emailaddress" with "first name", "last name" and "password".
	b) You can create it a standard DB or use the MS Account Controller with TenantDB context
